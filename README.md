### Project Proposal

### The information and sources of informaiton considered to test the proposal
The hypothesis that we were trying to test is 

The yahoo finance API is been used to collect the data for Australian Market Index.

### Finding from the Analysis 

1. We have discovered that there was significant drop in the household expenditure among people during the pendamic time 2020 and 2021 and it has started to regrow again. 

2. We have discovered that the spending of people has pretty much remained same expect some significant canges in the areas of a. telecommunicaiton, b. tobacco consumtion and c. transportation 

3. Unemployement is negetively correlated with the changes in spending in clothing (0.547129) and transport (0.580948) recretion (0.555207). There is a slightly positive correlation with alcohol (0.325923). 

4. Saving is positively correlated with alcohol spending (0.766694) and negatively correlated with operation_vehicle (0.873177, recreation 0.791215, hotel 0.799859.

### Possible use of Data 
Looking at the changes in data we can come up with a possible assumption that people are travelling less due to work from home arrangement. 

Spending in telecommunicaiton has increased due to advance work from home set up is causing people to spend more on telecoomunication for connectivity from home. 

Pople are more health concern since there is a significant drop in tobaco consumption and additional spending on health. 

If any business wants to invest their money they can work on investing in telecommunication, health related products. 

Car importers may need to think differently for introducing vehicles supporting recreation more than day to day transport. 


### Further Scope of Study 

What are the ares of telecoomunication people are spending and whether there is any scope of fintech companies to play role in that areas.
